However, the error might be occurring due to the following reasons:\n\n1. The \u0027Main\u0027 method is not accessible. In C#, the \u0027Main\u0027 method should be public or at least internal.

The \u0027Main\u0027 method should be declared as static since it\u0027s called by the runtime without any instance of the \u0060Program\u0060 class.\n\n3. The project is not set as a startup project. If you have multiple projects in your solution, ensure that the project containing the \u0027Main\u0027 method is set as the startup project.\n\n4.
